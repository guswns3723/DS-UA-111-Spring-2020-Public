    "What is the law of large numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLN states that if we take a sample of data, the mean of that sample will coverge to the mean of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean in english?\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, if we take a sample of data, the bigger the sample, the closer the mean of the sample will be to whatever the \"true\" mean is.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we wanted to know the average height of people in the U.S. \n",
    "\n",
    "The actual truth is if you actually measured the height of everyone in the country and took the mean. Thats the population mean, which I will call here as the \"truth\".\n",
    "\n",
    "But that's not practical, so instead we could take sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we took a sample of five people. Will the mean of those five people's heights be close to the \"truth\" (i.e., the true population mean)?  Maybe, but what if, just randomly, we only sampled people who were basketball players? Then the sample mean will be quite high, and far from the \"truth\".\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we had a sample of 50,000? \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll in that case it would be really, really hard for us to only have only tall people in our sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "What's going on?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well the population has tall people, short people, some REALLY tall people, and some pretty short people. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we only sample five people, then there is a good chance we may only get tall people, or only short people.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we sample 50,000 people, then we'll prolly get a lot of people from each group. Even more, we'll probably get the same proprotion of each group as there is in the general population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in our big sample will probably look a lot like the population, so our sample's mean will be really, really close to the \"truth\". \n",
    "\n",
    "So the LLN is just saying, the bigger your sample, the closer its mean is likely to be the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this so important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well the LLN basically says you can learn a lot about the population without measuring everyone. Just get a big sample, and you can get really close to \"truth\". \n",
    "\n",
    "That's the ENTIRE point of statistics. How can we learn about what is happening when we only have SOME of the data. That's statistics. That's the whole point. How do we learn when we don't know everything?\n",
    "\n",
