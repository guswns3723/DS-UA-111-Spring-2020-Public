    "\n",
    "So if I rolled a dice and got 1, and my hypothesis is that the dice is fair, then the p-value is 1/6 or .166.\n",

    "Ok, so what if I rolled a dice twice and got one both times. We'll the probability of that is 1/6 * 1/6. \n",

    "# 3. Statistical Significance & Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does it mean what a finding is \"statistically significant\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many scientific studies, particularly empirical studies, test a hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Null Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is the researchers test what is a called a <b> \"null\" </b> hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the null as a baseline. Is it the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I want to test if there is a relationship between smoking and cancer, the null hypothesis is that there is no relation ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null is the starting point. It is conservative, in that when we are testing to see if there is a relationship between two things, we almost always start by assuming there is no relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b> \"alterative\" </b> hypothesis is that the null is not true. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if our null is that there is no relationship between smoking and cancer, our alternative hypothesisis that there is a relationship between smoking and cancer. \n",
    "\n",
    "So our null is always conservative, in the sense that we assume (as our baseline) in the null, that what we think might be there is not there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing the Null\n",
    "\n",
    "We then do an experiment, or use data, and test the null. If we find no strong evidence against the null then we \"fail to reject the null\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if we find strong evidence against the null, we \"reject the null\". We do not accept the alternative - because we don't know that it is true, we just have strong evidence the null isn't true.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistical Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is statistical significance? \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical significance is the criteria we either meet, and reject the null, or we do not meet, and then we fail to reject the null.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, statistical significance is the rule we use to decide if we are going to reject or fail to reject null.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is this rule?\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we use the P-value!\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the P-value assumes a hypothesis. In this case, we assume the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then see how likely the data, or something more extreme, is likely to occur, if we assume the null.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the P-value is below a certain threshold, we reject the null, otherwise we fail to reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So statistical significance is determined by the threshold that the field (economics, political science, physics, etc) has decided is the threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical significance is just a way of formally saying \"the P-value is below our threshold, so we can reject the null hypothesis\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, the data is so unlikely to occur given the null hypothesis, that we reject the null. \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical significance is just formally identifying what the threshold is for unlikely.\n",
    "\n",
    "For much of the social sciences, that value is .05 or 5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which means that if we get a P-value, given a null, below .05, then we can reject the null. \n",
    "\n",
    "It also means that we know we will reject the null sometimes, EVEN WHEN THE NULL IS TRUE!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistical Significance is not Perfect!\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because we know, if the null is true, that sometimes weird/rare thing things do happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data that only occurs under the null 5% of the time or less (P-vale of .05 or less) does actually occur, its just rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we will reject the null if the P-value is that low, even if the null is true and the data we have is just weird.\n",
    "\n",
